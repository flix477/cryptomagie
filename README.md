# cryptomagie ðŸ§™

first of all, don't use this.

second, this is a repo following the very nice challenges at https://cryptopals.com/. If you would like to hop on the dark arts of crypto, try your hand at them.

third, i am using these challenges as an excuse to ~~procrastinate my homework~~ learn new languages, so if a line looks blasphemous to you, kindly let me know
